algorithms is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output
which algorithm is the best for a given application depends on the number of items,the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted, possible restriction on the item values, the architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory,disks,or even tapes.

NP-complete problems:
like traveling-salesman problem 

GUI graphical user interface
advanced computer architectures and fabrication technologies
object-oriented systems
integrated Web technologies
fast networking 

2 Getting Started
2.1 Insertion sort
  Software Engineering:
	data abstraction
	modularity
	error handling
  pseudocode:clear concise
INSERTION-SORT(A)
  for j=2 to A.length
  	key=A[j];
	i=j-1;
	while i>0and A[i]>key
		A[i+1]=A[i];
		i=i-1;
	A[i+1]=key
loop invariants:
Initialization,Maintenance,Termination

Pseudocode conventions:
	Indentation indicates block structure
	// means comment
	variables are local to the given procedure
	organize compound data into objects ,which are
	  composed of attributes
	pass parameters by value
	arrays are passed by pointer
	allow multiple values to be returned in a single return statement
	boolean operators "and" and "or" are short circuiting
exercises:
2.1-3
	LINEAR-SEARCH(A,v)
	  i=0;
	 do
	   i=i+1;
	  while(A[i]!=v and i<i.length)
